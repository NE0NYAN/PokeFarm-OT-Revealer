# PokeFarm Original Trainer (OT) Retriever
This is a userscript add-on designed for the browser game [PokeFarmQ](https://pokefarm.com).
The script injects an HTML element into a Pokemon's Summary Page that identifies their Original Trainer (OT).

The on-site forum thread about this can be found [here](https://pfq.link/~-B06). If you have any issues, it is prefered to post in that thread then in the GitHub.
